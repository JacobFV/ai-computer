## **1. System Call Handler**

### **Function**: Handle system calls initiated by processes

### **Process**

- **When a syscall interrupt is triggered**:
  1. **Identify the calling process**:
     - Retrieve the process ID from the interrupt context.
  2. **Read the system call request**:
     - Access the syscall line in the process's memory space to get the system call details.
  3. **Determine the system call type**:
     - Parse the syscall request to identify the command (e.g., `read_file`, `write_file`, `create_process`).
  4. **Execute the appropriate handler**:
     - **If the syscall is `read_file`**:
       - Call the `handle_read_file` function with the provided file path and return address.
     - **If the syscall is `write_file`**:
       - Call the `handle_write_file` function with the file path, content, and status return address.
     - **If the syscall is `create_process`**:
       - Call the `handle_create_process` function with the process name and executable address.
     - **If the syscall is `delete_process`**:
       - Call the `handle_delete_process` function with the process ID.
     - **Handle other syscalls similarly**.
  5. **Return the result**:
     - Write the result or status code to the calling process's return value line.
  6. **Resume the process execution**:
     - Update the instruction pointer to the next instruction.
